If you are asked to add global styles, put (or edit) Sass partials that output CSS into `src/sass/components` and put (or edit) Sass partials that do _not_ output CSS (like defining colors, functions, or mixins) into `src/sass/global`. Reuse existing partials if they exist. Import partials into `src/sass/style.scss` but when doing so, **DO NOT** include the leading underscore for the file name.
