difficulty: intermediate
requirements: patience
instructions:
  - ingredients:
      - name: Large Eggs
        amount: 6
      - name: Kosher Salt
        amount: 1 pinch
      - name: Unsalted Butter
        amount: 1 tbsp
    procedure:
      - Preheat nonstick skillet over low heat, adding the butter and allowing it to melt, but not foam.
      - Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the salt, and mix together until whites and yolks are well combined.
      - Add the eggs to the skillet and, with a silicone or rubber spatula, stir constantly until all of the liquid has evaporated. You'll be left with very small egg curds that glisten and appear gooey. This should take about 20 minutes. You'll know you're close when the eggs no longer slide back when you move them around in the skillet.
  - ingredients:
      - name: Thick-Cut Brioche Loaf
        amount: 2 slices
      - name: Thinly Sliced Scallion Greens
        amount: 1/4 cup
      - name: Fresh Ground Black Pepper
        amount: As needed
    procedure:
      - Toast the bread, add 1/2 of the eggs on top (they should be gooey and stay in placed when added, even spreadable), and top with scallion greens and black pepper, to taste.

This one is Annie's favorite breakfast, super slow scrambled eggs on toast. The key to this recipe is patience. You need to keep the eggs moving over low heat, slowly driving all of the water out until what you're left with is almost jam-like in consistency. Because you'll be tempted to pump up the heat, and because they need constant attention, I think they're an intermediate difficulty dish. Trust me when I say that your patience is well rewarded! These eggs come out gooey and buttery, and may just be the best you've ever eaten.
