Since you've taken the time to come to my site, I think it's only appropriate to tell you a little bit about myself. First and foremost, my name is Sam, and the pleasure is all mine. I'm the UI Architect for [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/), part of the awesome [design team](http://www.ibm.com/design/), where I wax philosophical about [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com)+[Compass](http://www.compass-style.com), [Responsive Web Design](/musings/principles-responsive-web-design), [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org), [Photography](/gallery), and, on occasion, bacon. I also make all of the above, sometimes dipped in chocolate. I got my start with the [New York State Senate](http://www.nysenate.gov) and the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org) where I was instilled with a great love for Open Source, Open Government, and an Open World, which caries on to this day.

Also, this site suffers from a horrible case of the cobbler's children having no shoes; sorry about that.

## Stuff I've Done

I have led the Sass BoF at DrupalCon London, talked the New York Drupal User Group's collective ears off about Sass, co-presented a 2 hour long Sass+Compass session at DrupalCamp New York 2011 with bonus BoF, gave a one hour introduction to Sass+Compass at SandCamp 2012 with bonus BoFs, co-led the Getting Started with Sass+Compass, Advanced Sass+Compass, and Responsive Design with Sass+Compass BoFs at DrupalCon Denver and spoke on Responsive Web Design with Sass and Compass at [DrupalCon Munich](http://snugug.com/munich). I also co-organize the [New York Sass Meetup](http://meetup.com/nyc-sass) and organize the [New York Responsive Web Design Meetup](http://meetup.com/rwd-nyc).

With all of this work, I've contributed quite a bit of knowledge and resources back to the Web Designa and Development community. I am the co-maintainer of [Sassy Math](github.com/scottkellum/Sassy-math) providing advanced, Ruby powered math functions to Sass, the co-maintainer of [Breakpoint](http://github.com/canarymason/breakpoint) and maintainer of [Respond-to](http://github.com/snugug/respond-to) both of which make wrangling your media queries in Sass easier, the co-maintainer of [Singularity](https://github.com/scottkellum/singularity) allowing for awesome, advanced symmetric and asymmetric grids in Sass, the maintainer of [Toolkit](https://github.com/snugug/toolkit) providing a collection of functions and mixins to make responsive web design and progressive enhancement drop dead easy with Sass, the maintainer of [Style Sites](https://github.com/snugug/style-sites) that aims make Design in Browser and Style Guide based design easy for everyone, and the maintainer of the [Borealis Suite](http://drupal.org/project/borealis) which includes a way for you to have semantic Drupal blocks and, more amusingly, my take on a Drupal specific Responsive Image solution.

## Talk With Me About Stuff

If there is anything you'd particularly like to tell me, [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Snugug) is the best way to get a hold of me. If you're interested in emailing me, sam [at] snug [dot] ug will do. If you're looking to get in contact with me about one of my projects, please file an issue on their designated issue boards (for my Drupal stuff, probably on Drupal.org, for everything else, probably on GitHub).

## Licenses for My Stuff

While you are perusing my site, you'll come across some code snippets and some photographs. Generally speaking, all of the Drupal related code on this site is licensed under the [GPL-2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), any code showing the inner workings of a project i've worked on is licensed under that specific project's license, and anything else is Public Domain (unless otherwise stated) and therefore free for you to use anyway you'd like, although I'm always interested if you do something really cool with it. All of my photography is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/). All of my projects have individual licenses associated with them so take a look at each of the separately to see what its license is. If you use any of my things not in line with the licenses attached to them, well now that's fairly rude of you, isn't it?

## Disclaimer and Stuff

Besides being a sassy sassy man, I'm fairly sarcastic and tend to speak my mind. As such, if you're particularly offended by anything I say, either understand that it's probably tinged with a heavy dose of sarcasm, that it's my opinion and I'm entitled to it damnit, or, stop reading. I won't be offend, I promise. You will not change my opinion by being offended, just as I probably won't change yours for the same reason. On this website, I speak for myself, not for any current, former, or future employers or the communities I'm a part of even if my words are echoed by others (or even myself in a alter-official ego).
