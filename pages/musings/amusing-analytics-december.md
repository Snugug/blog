Just decided to take a look at my analytics for the month of December 2012, and I thought they were amusing, so I've decided to share. I use Google Analytics, as a frame of reference. In the month of December, I had 1,408 visitors to my site. They averaged 1.54 pages per visit and 1:32 on site. 70.38% of them were new.

## Location

My site was visited by users in 74 Countries/Territories with at least one page view from every continent on the planet (Antartica notwithstanding). The most active continent was Europe, with 620 visits. The least active was Africa, with just 5. There were 18 visits from a *(not set)* continent. The most active sub continent regions were North America followed by West, North, East, than South Europe. The least active sub continent region was the Caribbean, followed by East, South, and North Africa.

The 15 most active countries were, in descending order:
1. United States
2. United Kingdom
3. Germany
4. India
5. Russia
6. Netherlands
7. Canada
8. Belgium
9. Australia
10. France
11. Ukraine
12. Greece
13. Italy
14. Switzerland
15. Israel

The 15 least active countries with at least one visit were, in ascending order:
1. Uruguay
2. Uganda
3. Paraguay
4. Maldives
5. Myanmar [Burma]
6. Montenegro
7. Moldova
8. Lebanon
9. Iceland
10. Ecuador
11. Dominican Republic
12. Bulgaria
13. Argentina
14. United Arab Emirates
15. South Africa

The 15 most active cities were, in descending order:
1. New York
2. London
3. Saratov
4. Gent
5. Dnipropetrovs'k
6. Sydney
7. Khania
8. Ramat Gan
9. Amsterdam
10. Zurich
11. Moscow
12. Ardmore
13. League City
14. Paris
15. Bangalore

The 4th most active city was (not set), so it was omitted.

## Technology
As someone who argues for cross-browser compatibility and a mobile-first approach to all things web, Technology I find particularly interesting. Overall, I have 24 distinct Browser/Operating System pairings, with 87 different browser versions. Most of the different Browser/OS pairings come from Mobile. For purposes of the following statistics, when it says Safari (in-app), it's referring to opening a website in an application on an iOS device that is neither the default Safari app, nor one of the major secondary iOS browsers (Chrome, Opera Mini, etcâ€¦).

The Top 15 most active browsers/OS pairs were, in descending order:
1. Chrome/Mac
2. Chrome/Windows
3. Safari/Mac
4. Safari (in-app)/iOS
5. Firefox/Windows
6. Chrome/Linux
7. Firefox/Mac
8. Safari/iOS
9. Firefox/Linux
10. IE/Windows
11. Chrome/Android
12. Chrome/iOS
13. Android Browser/Android
14. Opera/Windows
15. Mozilla Compatible Agent/Mac

I get more combined Android traffic than I get IE traffic. My two most popular versions of IE are 8 and 9, both tied, with 10 a distant 3rd and 6 and 7 with one a piece.

One thing I've found is, I really need to figure out a nice wide layout for my site.I've got 60 distinct screen resolution, the largest being 6400x4000 (that's larger than the 4k beasts coming out, and it wasn't a bounce; they stuck around for a while!) and the smallest being 228x240. If we do the maths, that's a 6172x3760 area that my site should cover and cover well. That's just silly!

Top 15 screen resolutions are, frankly, bordering on ginormous. They are, in descending order:
1. 1920x1080
2. 1440x900
3. 2560x1440
4. 1366x768
5. 1680x1050
6. 1280x800
7. 1920x1200
8. 230x480
9. 768x1024
10. 1280x1024
11. 320x568
12. 1600x900
13. 1024x768
14. 2560x1600
15. 1600x1200

## Mobile

Google Analytics' Mobile data includes what they define as tablets and down as mobile traffic and everything else as not mobile traffic. While not entirely satisfied with those definitions, we'll run with it for the sake of this post.

Over the month of December, a little over 20% of all of my site's traffic was from mobile devices. While both mobile and not mobile both have approximately the same number of pages per visit, mobile users stayed on the site a full minute less than non mobile, but also had 15.22% more new visits with only 7.51% more bounces.

What everyone really wants to know about Mobile, though, is what devices people are browsing from. While I truly despise UA sniffing, and I'm assuming that's what GA is doing, I'm going to give it to you! So, the top 10 mobile devices to come to my site in December are, in descending order:
1. Apple iPhone (includes all versions)
2. Apple iPad (includes all versions, including mini)
3. Google Nexus 7
4. Samsung Galaxy Nexus
5. Apple iPod
6. HTC Vision
7. Motorola MZ604 Xoom
8. Samsung GT-I9300 Galaxy S3
9. Samsung SGH-I897 Galaxy S Captivate
10. SonyEricsson LT18i Xperia Arc

Number 5 was *(not set)* so, again, I left it out of the rankings. Some interesting secondary characteristics from these devices. While the iPhone and iPad collectively blow Android out of the water with number of visits (iPads total 76 visits at number 2, Google Nexus 7 totals 8 visits at number 3), it's actually the Android users that spend more time on the site. The four devices that, on average, spent the most amount of time on my site are all Android devices with the top device averaging 6:14 on site compared to the iPhone's 0:56 and iPads's 0:29.

Ok, I think that about wraps it up! If there's anything you're particularly interested in knowing that I haven't covered, let me know and if I can I'll let you know!
