Thanks to everyone who came out to see my session. The slides from my talk are available [here](http://snugug.com/sites/default/files/session_0.pdf). Please remember to [rate my session](http://munich2012.drupal.org/node/add/session-evaluation/249?destination=node/249) and be sure to come to my [Birds of a Feather sessions](http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/schedule/bofs/2012-08-22) tomorrow. I'll be holding three of them in the same room right in a row, a sort of mini Sass+Compass training going from installation through the topics presented in my talk and anything anyone else wants to talk about. I will also be around during the sprints and am happy to hold "Sass Office Hours" of sorts to help people out.

Here is the video of my talk

If you'd like to get a hold of me to chat while at the conference, ping me on Twitter [@Snugug](http://twitter.com/snugug).

Also, I've got Sassy Drupal stickers! Find me to get yourself one!
