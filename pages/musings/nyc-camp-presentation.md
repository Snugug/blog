A big thanks to everyone who came out to my presentation yesterday. My slides can be [downloaded here](http://snugug.com/sites/default/files/session.pdf) and have lots of good links in there for continued learning. The responsive image solution I built for Drupal is [Borealis](http://drupal.org/project/borealis). If you have any questions, let me know in a comment below or by pinging me on Twitter [@Snugug](http://twitter.com/snugug). Enjoy!
