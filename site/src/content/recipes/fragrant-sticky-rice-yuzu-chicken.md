When I first came up with this recipe for fragrant sticky rice, it was such a revelation in our house that it's become a practical staple on our table. Cooking it in a pressure cooker means that it doesn't need to be presoaked and can be done on a weeknight. But rice alone does not a dish make. After experimenting with a few different vegetable and topping options, I finally settled on leafy Chinese veggies and this diced yuzu marinated chicken; the combination of everything is truly hard to beat. With the marinade coming together quickly the night before, this is a tasty and easy weeknight dish.
