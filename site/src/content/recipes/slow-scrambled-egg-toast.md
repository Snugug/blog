      active: '30 minutes'
    ingredients:
      - name: 'Large eggs'
        amount: '6'
      - name: 'Unsalted butter'
        amount: '1 tbsp'
      - name: 'Kosher salt'
        amount: '1 pinch'
    procedure:
      - 'Preheat nonstick skillet over low heat, adding the butter and allowing it to melt, but not foam.'
      - 'Crack the eggs into a bowl, add the salt, and whisk together until whites and yolks are well combined.'
      - "Add the eggs to the skillet and, with a silicone or rubber spatula, stir constantly until all of the liquid has evaporated. You'll be left with very small egg curds that glisten and appear gooey. This should take about 20 minutes. You'll know you're close when the eggs no longer slide back when you move them around in the skillet."

This one is Annie's favorite breakfast, super slow scrambled eggs on toast. The key to this recipe is patience. You need to keep the eggs moving over low heat, slowly driving all of the water out until what you're left with is almost jam-like in consistency. Because you'll be tempted to pump up the heat, and because they need constant attention, I think they're an intermediate difficulty dish. Trust me when I say that your patience is well rewarded! These eggs come out gooey and buttery, and may just be the best you've ever eaten.
