For the past five years, this has been my family's go-to Thanksgiving dressing recipe. It came to be thanks to two unexpected circumstances coming together at the same time. The first was meeting my partner; this was our first Thanksgiving together and she mostly eats vegetarian. That means our normally meat-filled dressing wasn't going to cut it. The second was my best friend being the definition of _extra_.

See, my friend was driving through Pennsylvania on his way to Thanksgiving at his parents, and in doing so, he was going to pass by mushroom farms. Did you know Pennsylvania grows [the majority of all mushrooms in the country](https://dced.pa.gov/paproudblog/did-you-know-pennsylvania-is-home-to-the-largest-grower-of-specialty-mushrooms/)? He called and asked if I wanted some mushrooms, I said yes, and he turned up with a 5lb box of mixed mushrooms, ranging from portobello to oysters to shiitakes to creminis, all for $16. Long story short: I had more mushrooms than I knew what to do with.

From there, the rest of the recipe kinda fell together. I found potato bread stuffing cubes at my supermarket, and thought it'd be a nice addition. The slightly sweet, slightly earthy, super soft qualities of potato bread happen to make for amazing stuffing cubes. I didn't want to use chicken stock like I normally would, and like the potato bread cubes, I found mushroom stock at my supermarket, something I thought would give better flavor than just vegetable stock (fortifying with the dried mushrooms came the year after) I was (and still am) a little obsessed with brown butter, and knew that its nuttiness would go well with the mushrooms and goes with sage, so the butter and aromatics just fell into place.

As if you needed any more proof how much I love this dressing, the first Thanksgiving after I was [diagnosed with diabetes](/musings/a-beginners-guide-to-diabetes/) and was keeping myself on a very strict 30 grams of net carbs per day diet, I wrote this note in my low-carb Thanksgiving recipe guide:

> While not technically low carb, the actual bread used is 16g net carbs per cup, and if you're going to splurge on carbs for any part of the meal, it may as well be the dressing.
