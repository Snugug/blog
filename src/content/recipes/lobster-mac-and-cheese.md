Now technically this is radiatore and cheese, but you wouldn’t have known what I meant if I said that! Radiatore have a great shape for holding on to the cheese sauce, and the lobster adds nice sweet pops throughout the dish. If you can’t find radiatore, campanelle, fusilli, and even shells can do in a pinch. Just avoid elbow macaroni. You want a pasta that will hold on to the cheese sauce you’re making! If you want to just use the macaroni and cheese recipe, I’d remove the tarragon and keep the rest the same. You can also make macaroni and cheese cupcakes by dividing the recipe into a buttered and floured cupcake tray.
