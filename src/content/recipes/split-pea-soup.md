Another vegan soup recipe to add to my collection! The challenge with making split pea soup vegetarian is that a major source of flavor comes from ham bones or ham hocks, which impart smokey, meaty, umami notes into the soup. Split pea soup really needs these flavors, so to get the meaty and umami notes, I've made this with mushroom broth instead of the usual water. For the smokey notes, I've utilized one of my new favorite ingredients, chipotle paste, which adds the smokey flavor without a hint on spicy in the final product. Once the ham is replaced, the soup is, surprisingly vegan!
