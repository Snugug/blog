      - 'Grease the bottom and sides of the cake pan with the non-stick spray'

      - 'Let eggs cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then invert the pan onto a cutting board to release the eggs.'
      - 'Cut into 4 equal sized pieces'
      - "Use one slice per sandwich to build your sandwich how you'd like!"

These infinitely customizable, meal-prep friendly sandwiches, inspired by America's Test Kitchen's [Kimchi Egg Sandwichs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_TWsKjlNkE), take inspiration from tamago sushi, a savory, slightly sweet rolled egg omelette. Tamago sushi is one of my favorites, and I find the additional flavors pair really well with savory breakfast flavors like cheese and breakfast meats.

For the dashi, I make a batch of Serious Eat's [Basic Japanese Dashi](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-japanese-dashi-recipe). Don't worry about having extra, this recipe comes together so fast that I find myself going through the dashi pretty quickly as I keep making more eggs. If you still find yourself with too much, make some miso soup! As described in the America's Test Kitchen video, the liquid added to the eggs will help to tenderize them. The dashi is light in flavor so doesn't detract from the overall "egginess" of the eggs but does lend a subtle savoriness to them. The mirin, a Japanese cooking wine, adds slight sweetness, and the soy sauce adds another hit of savoriness and some saltiness. Together, they provide a great set of undertones to the eggs, elevating them without diluting the egg-forward flavor that the original recipe strives for.

The eggs are great fresh out of the oven, and but the real magic of this recipe is how well they keep in the fridge. Once cooled and cut, you can place these in the fridge in an airtight container and they'll stay for a few days. Reheating is super easy; pop one in the microwave for 60 seconds! To construct sandwiches, because the eggs are super tender, I recommend a soft roll, like brioche or challah, that's been lightly toasted. Load it up with whatever your favorite condiments and breakfast sandwich toppings! Pictured I've got some chopped kimchi, some Canadian bacon, and a slice of melted low-moisture mozzarella. I also find a slice of cheddar cheese, optionally microwaved for about 15 seconds on top of the eggs to melt it, and a slice or two of Taylor ham or Canadian bacon, heated stove-top or likewise zapped for 60 seconds on a paper towel, are great accompaniments.

Tasty, filling breakfast sandwiches in less than 5 minutes every morning; what's not to love?
