When I first came up with this recipe for fragrant sticky rice, it was such a revelation in our house that it's become a practical staple on our table. Cooking it in a pressure cooker means that it doesn't need to be presoaked and can be done on a weeknight. But rice alone does not a dish make. After experimenting with a few different vegetable and topping options, I finally settled on leafy chinese veggies and this diced yuzu marinated chicken, and the combination of everything is truly hard to beat. With the marinade coming together quickly the night before, this is a tasty and easy weeknight dish.
