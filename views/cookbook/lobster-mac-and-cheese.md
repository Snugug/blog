      - Place the lobster head-first into boiling water and boil for 7-8 minutes for 1½lb lobsters, 8-10 minutes for 2lb lobsters. Slightly under-cooking the lobster here is okay as we'll be baking it later.

  - ingredients:
      - name: Dried Radiatore Pasta
        amount: 8oz

      - In a large bowl, mix together the cheese and the cornstartch until cheese is evenly coated.
      - In a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat, add the milk and tarragon and bring to a boil, stirring often, and then reduce to a simmer.
      - Stir in the mustard and salt and pepper to taste.
      - Stir in the cheese until it melts and is smooth.

Now technically this is radiatore and cheese, but you wouldn’t have known what I meant if I said that! Radiatore have a great shape for holding on to the cheese sauce, and the lobster adds nice sweet pops throughout the dish. If you can’t find radiatore, campanelle, fusilli, and even shells can do in a pinch. Just avoid elbow macaroni. You want a pasta that will hold on to the cheese sauce you’re making! If you want to just use the macaroni and cheese recipe, I’d remove the tarragon and keep the rest the same. You can also make macaroni and cheese cupcakes by dividing the recipe into a buttered and floured cupcake tray.
