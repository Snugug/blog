I've been exploring more vegetarian and vegan cooking recently, and making cookies for my team, where one is vegan, gave me a perfect opportunity to figure out a tasty vegan cookie recipe! I never grew up on peanut butter cookies, but after doing some research they seemed like the best recipe to start with! After looking at a few recipes, I came up with this recipe, and I think it's pretty tasty! Annie does too, so I think they're a win. Don't be surprised if they're dry, though, these are peanut butter cookies after all!

Some notes on the recipe: bananas are there to add moisture and provide a nice fruity flavor to the cookies. To ensure the cookies are vegan, make sure the dark chocolate is 100% dark. You could probably substitute maple syrup for the brown sugar and almond flour for the all-purpose flour to make these Paleo friendly, too (the vanilla is up to you there), but I haven't tried it. If you do, let me know!
