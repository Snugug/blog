![Headshot of Sam](/images/me/square.jpg){.headshot}

Hey there! I'm Sam! I work at [Google](https://www.google.com) as a Developer Advocate for Chrome OS!

Prior to Google, I worked at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) as the UI Architect for Websites and Platform for [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/), the Agile Team Experience Lead for the CIO, and the engineering lead for IBM's Digital Technical Engagement team. I got my start with the [New York State Senate](http://www.nysenate.gov) and have worked for the [World Economic Forum](http://www.weforum.org) and [NBCUniversal](http://www.nbcuniversal.com/) where a love of Open Source, Open Government, and generally an Open World were instilled and reinforced.

I do quite a bit of public speaking and training. Most of my [presentations](https://snugug.com/presentations/) are available online, with some even having videos! If you see me out at a conference, come say hi! I also have contributed a lot of open source work, which you can get to from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/snugug).

If you wanna chat with me, the best way to is to ping me on Twitter [@Snugug](http://www.twitter.com/Snugug). If it's something about one of the projects I maintain, please file an issue instead of pinging me directly.

**The Professional**

He has a background leading software architecture, development, design, and strategy for the web at Fortune 100 companies, and loves being able to share the knowledge he's gained doing so with anyone interested through teaching, speaking, and open source work. Outside of work, Sam is an avid amateur chef, foodie, and photographer, and often combines all three.
