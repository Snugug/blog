_**I am not a doctor**. This is my personal story about what I've learned over the past year and what I've done under my doctor's supervision. Please talk to your doctor before changing how you manage your health._

My story starts Labor Day weekend 2021. My partner and I were on vacation in Lake George, NY. It was our first vacation since the pandemic began. We rented a little house all to ourselves on the lake. It was a lovely trip. On our drive home, we picked up an early dinner. When we got home, instead of eating it, I fell asleep for the rest of the day. I didn't think anything of it, I thought I was just tired.

For the next six weeks, every once in a while, I would have a day where I was just too tired to do anything, and would sleep the whole day. I lost 30lb without changing my diet. I also drank a lot of water. Around 3 liters a day. Besides that, though, I generally felt really good. Whenever I would have a tired spell, I would take a COVID test, and nothing, so I made a doctor's appointment. I saw the doctor, explained what was going on, had blood drawn, and that was that. That was October 12, 2021.

The next day, I got a frantic (for a doctor) call. I was asked if I was sure if I had fasted before my blood tests. I assured them I had. I was told I needed to come back in as soon as possible. I made an appointment for the next day, Thursday, October 14th, 2021.

If you read the title of the article, you know what my diagnosis was. I was told I was diabetic. Really, really diabetic. My heart absolutely sank. I've been overweight my entire life. Up until that point, the only things I really knew about diabetes were it was sugar related, it was stigmatized as being a "fat person disease" that could cause you to loose a foot and lead to death. I knew there were needles involved. And of course, [Wilford Brimley's "diabetus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rm9BZ1osiM). I've been terrified of this diagnosis since high school. But just how bad was my diagnosis? Well, a here's the first of many "medical things I've learned over the past year":

- Diabetes is all about insulin, the main hormone in our bodies that regulate how what we eat becomes energy for our body. It's a big deal. There are two main kinds of diabetics, Type 1 diabetics, who do not produce insulin (or, as a friend describes, a Type 1.5 diabetic who no longer can due to some other circumstances), and Type 2 diabetics who do produce insulin, but it either isn't enough, or their body is resistant to the insulin they do produce.
- There are a number of tests to determine if someone is diabetic and what kind, but from what I've been able to understand, there are two main ones: a C-peptide test to determine if the body makes insulin, and a Hemoglobin A1c test to measure the average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months, measured as a percentage. If your body produces insulin, your A1c is the indicator of if you're considered diabetic.
- A1c is broken down into three ranges, <5.7 is considered normal or non-diabetic, 4.7-6.4 is considered at risk of becoming diabetic or pre-diabetic, and >=6.5 is considered diabetic. The A1c range for diabetes is usually given from 6-12. The scale stops as 12.

My A1c was 11.3. Probably gallows humor in hindsight, but I remember telling my partner the doctors were probably surprised I felt fine and was able to walk around with an A1c that high. The only good news? I made insulin, so I was Type 2 diabetic, not Type 1.

The endocrinologist who diagnosed me saw me for about 20 minutes.

First up was denial. I don't eat much sugar! I basically don't drink! I rarely have soda! I don't even really do desserts! What I didn't know was all carbohydrates turn into sugar when digested, so the bagels and apples I was eating were just as bad. I needed to drastically change how I ate and move to a super low-carb diet. To help me navigate this, I was given a piece of paper with about 24 items on it, 12 each of low-carb and high-carb foods.

I was told I couldn't walk around barefoot anymore. The nerve endings in the soles of my feet may just stop working and I may wind up scorching the bottom of my feet like some horror story they knew of some guy at a pool. In fact, I could loose my feet entirely. In fact, go make a podiatrist appointment. Here's a referral. This is where anger set in. I hate shoes. I've given talks on international stages barefoot. Needing to be shoed at all times was unthinkable for me.

I also needed to go make an optometrists appointment. Turns out the extra sugar in my blood could build up in my eyes and cause me to go blind.

Finally,I got my meds and my monitor. My endo showed me briefly how to use my blood glucose monitor, the finger prick thing. I was prescribed two medications: Metformin, a drug to help my body better use the insulin it makes, and Jardiance, a drug that blocks extra glucose from being reabsorbed by the kidneys. And that was it! That is how I was told I have a life-altering chronic illness and the instructions I was given to manage it.

I got home, took the rest of the day off, and picked up my meds. I don't remember what I had for dinner that night, but I do remember being upset that all I had wanted all week was a cheesesteak, and now I didn't know if I could ever have one again.

The next morning, I started my new routine. I took my blood glucose level, often shortened to blood sugar. It took me pricking my finger 3 time to get a working sample. I wasn't taught how to fill the strips, or how to prick my finger to make it hurt less. I screamed in frustration, a bloody finger, and no idea how to get it to work, until it did. It was 264 mg/dL. 269 mg/dL is the estimated average for an A1c of 11. I took my meds.

That day, I tried to eat a low-carb diet. The pamphlet I was given wasn't super helpful. I don't really remember eating much.

Saturday was fine. Sunday morning, I went to the farmer's market, and when I came home, I felt like crap. I went to sleep for the rest of the day.. Monday, I still felt like crap. I took my blood sugar throughout the day and it was between 144-146 each time; high, but not dangerously so. I stayed in bed all day. I had water, and tried to have some Gatorade, a desperate attempt to have something in my system, not knowing if it was OK or not for me to drink. Tuesday, was the same. I had a telemedicine check-in with my endo. They weren't able to diagnose anything, and recommended I go to the ER.

So, it turns out I had diabetic ketoacidosis. I was moved to the intensive care unit. I had my finger pricked every few hours and was given regular insulin injections. I didn't really eat. I was in the ICU for 3 days. On the 3rd day, my partner later told me, she could tell I was feeling better because I had started complaining about the comfort (or lack there of) of the bed. I was finally moved from the ICU down to the general care area.

It took me being hospitalized for a life-threatening complication for me to get any real information about how I could manage my diabetes. I was on day 10 of being diagnosed. I had spent more time having the wonderful hospital staff manage it than I had. By the time Saturday had come around, I was feeling back to my old self and got to really dig into my diagnosis with the specialists who came to visit me:

- A nutrition team came in and gave me a small book's worth of information on how to manage my diabetes. They talked with me about different kinds of food and how they affect my blood sugar and gave me a ton of resources. They also set me up with a nutritionist to follow-up with after I left the hospital.
- I met with a new endocrinologist. She was fabulous. I asked her tons of questions. I learned what insulin resistance means and she confirmed my diagnosis (Type 2). She gave me guidelines for how many carbs I should eat and she even talked me through how she calculated that number. She described the different kinds of insulin, and when each is needed (before that, I didn't know there were different kinds!). At my request, she drew diagrams for me, wrote out formulas for me, and explained in detail basically every question I had about what was happening and why it was happening, from a biological perspective. Finally, she kicked me off Jardiance, having decided that that's probably what caused my DKA and said she wouldn't have started me on two drugs at once to manage my condition.

I was all set to leave, I had seen everyone, but then I had a showdown with who became my hospital arch-nemesis: the general practitioner who had to sign off on my release. I had gone through all of my required stuff to be released, but when I asked if I was going to be released that day, they said "no", I needed sign-off from the endo who I had met with. I got it, could I be released? Still no. They were concerned that I may have a blood clot in my legs from lying down for a few days, so I needed to go get an ultrasound. That was a multi-hour round-trip. Ok, could I go then? Still no! When you're in the hospital for DKA, you leave the hospital on insulin. A wonderful nurse came in and taught me how to inject myself with the insulin I'd be getting when I left. This was in the morning. Now, in the late afternoon, I was told I needed me to prove I could give myself my insulin shot. No problem, I thought, until the nurse brought it in for me. I had be taught how to use a home-use, pre-filled auto-injector. They wanted me to use an old-school needle drawing from a vial, which I hadn't been taught. I told them I absolutely couldn't do that, I hadn't been taught that. The GP didn't care. I was ready to refuse their service and request an new GP when I was told the endo had confidence I would do it at home, and the nurse came and gave me my shot. I was finally released around 6pm Saturday, the 23rd. For those curious, the hospital food wasn't bad.

Starting that Sunday, for the next two weeks. I stabbed my leg with an insulin shot every morning. Much like my first morning trying to get a blood sugar reading, I cried and yelled and cursed my situation every morning. I hated it. I didn't want this to be my life. I was deep into the depression stage. My diagnosing endo wanted me to come back in. I refused, and transferred my care to the new hospital endo. Fortunately, I had a 2-week checkup with my endo from the hospital. She saw I was keeping my blood sugar under control, and my final test results from the hospital, and she took me off the insulin and back onto Metformin. With Thanksgiving coming up, she also gave me one last bit of encouraging news: it was OK if my blood sugar got a little high, as long as it didn't stay high. I could splurge a little for Thanksgiving, as long as it came back in check. And if it didn't? I had the insulin to get it back in check. That single piece of advice has been the most helpful to me in living with my diabetes.

- After being released from the hospital, my endo had given me a diet of no more than 60 grams of carbs per day. For reference, the USDA guide recommendation is about 250 grams. Everything I knew about eating healthy was turned on its head. Veggies? Carbs. Fruit? Lots of carbs! Chicharrones? Just fat and protein! I can have as much of those as I want! Hot sauce? Basically nothing; throw that shit on everything! For the first time in my life, I had food I was afraid of. I broke down at dinner one night because I had to choose between eating peppers and onions or a tortilla with fajitas one night. But desperation breeds innovation. I wound up making buffalo mac and cheese with cauliflower rice, which became a real comfort food for me. We found a food delivery service that had carb counts on everything so I could plan my week's food out. But then, my partner being the lovely person she is, got me an anniversary present that required me to rethink how I dealt with food.
- Before I was diagnosed, knowing that I missed Austin, she had ordered me a bunch of sausage, jalapeno, and cheese kolaches. I was so excited to have them, but was so disappointed I couldn't. I had been using MyFitnessPal to track my carbs, and I found it lacking. I hated the interface. I hated needing to pay for it to set my goals. I hated that even after paying for it it pushed upsells. And more than anything, I hated that it had a bunch of random user-generated food in there that was neither reliable nor meaningfully portioned (think about what 1 slice of cheese _really_ means). I needed something better.
- When I started seriously tracking what I ate, I quickly started obsessing over nutrition labels. I noticed something important; all nutrition labels (in the US anyway) give serving size in either grams (weight) or milliliters (volume). Figuring out how many carbs I ate was a matter of measuring and multiplication. My best friend, a chemistry PhD, recommended I buy a scientific balance for my kitchen (aka a super fancy scale). I got one. This is really where my frustration with MyFitnessPal really manifested itself. I had precise measurements for what I was eating, and I couldn't properly track it! I started looking for a better way. I found the [USDA FoodCentral API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html). I had an idea. I was going to make my own app.
- Starting with the API, I made a simple PWA (using Svelte, Vite, Firebase functions, and Firestore, for those interested). Everything from the API is measured by weight or milliliters, letting me actually scale any food I put in. All food had cleanly structured data behind it! It was great! With that, I could start fixing some of the other problems I had with MyFitnessPal. The first thing I cared about, tracking my blood sugar and food together in a timeline view, so I could see how what I ate affected my blood sugar. Next, I added guard rails. I was told in no uncertain terms I couldn't eat less than 30 grams of carbs per day; that may push me into ketosis and my endo didn't want me to risk that having been hospitalized for that once. So, that meant I needed a min and a max for my carbs. My nutritionist wanted me to take notes about how I was feeling throughout the day, so I added that. I was told I needed to loose weight, so I added that. I was told my excess water drinking was a clear sign of diabetes, so I put in a way to track how uch water I was drinking. I now had a way to comprehensively track my health. I did what came naturally to me: take what I've learned and turned it into a scalable system. It gave me a safety net, something for me to unload my stress onto. I built something to help me process the trauma I had gone through. I built something to carry the burden of maintaining my health onto.

- Thanksgiving was my first big test. I hadn't really cooked since being diagnosed, and it's usually such a carb-heavy meal. I brought my scale, planned out my meal using my app, and weighed everything to the tenth of a gram. I made gravy using modernist techniques (xanthan gum and gelatin) instead of flour. I used monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar in my cranberry sauce. I made way too salty cauliflower puree. My family played along, and I really appreciate it. We did make Pillsbury biscuits and my potato bread, brown butter, sage, and mushroom dressing. It's something my partner likes too much, and I wasn't prepared to find a replacement for. I went into the day knowing it was going to be tough, and even with eating a little of everything, my blood sugar was OK the next day. I followed my doctor's advice, and it got me through Thanksgiving. It was my first real challenge to my diet, and I came through the other side fine.
- The next big challenge came in the middle of December. My partner had a business trip that required us to be in my old neighborhood in NYC. All of my favorite restaurants were there, and I didn't have my scale. I had a bagel for the first time from Russ & Daughters. I fought through anxiety and fear to order noodles from Momofuku Noodle Bar for dinner. I came out the other end OK again. I was doing well.
- I had a follow-up appointment with my endo in mid-January. I had been keeping really precise track of what I had been eating and my blood sugar. I felt good going into it. My A1c came back. 5.4. **_5.4_**. In 4 months, through diet alone, I had managed to bring my A1c down almost 6 points! Not only was I no longer in the diabetic range, I wasn't even in the prediabetic range! I was in a normal range! I had also lost weight! When I was admitted to the hospital, I weighed 250lb. I now weighed 224lb. I was feeling great. My endo was impressed. She thought, going into the appointment, that she'd need to increase my Metformin dosage but, given where I was, she kept it the same. The system I had put in place was working.
- The next big challenge was an end of February weekend trip to Philadelphia with my partner. This was a big test for me, I decided to not track what I ate while I was there. We had a great weekend, but more importantly, I finally got the cheesesteak I had been craving since October. Throw in some big soft pretzels, some great Chinese noodles and dumplings, and the first (and only since) indoor dinner we've had at a restaurant since the start of the pandemic, and for the first time since being diagnosed I felt kind of normal. And my blood sugar kept in range.
- In March, my partner came through again. She found a local drive-in movie theater. We had been craving going back to the movies. I was ready to try blowing my carb limit out of the water, and see what happens. I had a bag of buttered popcorn and Sno-Caps. It was delicious. I had really missed popcorn snacks. The next morning, my blood sugar was fine again.
- By April, thanks to the success of my attempts at pushing up my carb limit, I decided to go wild and allow myself up to 90 grams of carbs per day! I could now have a full sandwich, on regular bread, for lunch, and not go over my carb limit! It felt freeing.
- By this time, I had expanded my app. I had added exercise tracking. I had deeply investigated choosing and tracking macros, the ratio of carbs, fat, and protein that make up your daily caloric intake, and added a whole system to manage and update it as your weight changes. I had built in A1c estimation. I had built graphs to show weight and blood sugar trends. I added body fat percentage and BMI tracking. I put in the ability to generate reports! I had as close to a fully-connected view of food, blood sugar, weight, and exercise as I could have hoped for at that point. And the system worked.
- I had my 2nd check-in with my end on May 10, 2022. I now weighed 196lb. My app had estimated my A1c to be 5.4. It was 5.1. The only way it could have been more accurate is if I took my blood sugar more. I felt fantastic. My endo told me she talks about me to her other patients as proof that diet can control your diabetes. She _reduced_ my Metformin dosage, even suggesting that if I didn't want to, I could stop taking it! She didn't think she needed to see me again until November. I still needed to exercise more. Fair.
- By this time, I had my eye set on a weight loss goal: 180lb. Before I started drastically losing weight in September of 2021, I weighed about 285lb. Loosing over 100lb felt like a good, and now reachable, goal for me. By the end of June, [I had lost 100lb](https://twitter.com/Snugug/status/1539962798129774592?s=20&t=9A1s_HytEmnHjx17HD660w). We went to a destination wedding mid-July and I overate a little. [I hit my goal mid-August](https://twitter.com/Snugug/status/1558591617078071296?s=20&t=9A1s_HytEmnHjx17HD660w). I've updated my macros from lose weight to maintain it.
- This week, I finished the final feature I've wanted to build into my app for a long time: routines. Set up checks for logging anything in the app on a reoccurring basis, optionally within a time range, and get a gold star if you complete it. I built it to give me a visual indicator of whether I took my medicine each day. And that bring me to today, writing this for y'all.
